# IdentityServer in Docker – Step-by-Step Guide Source Code

## Background
This repository contains the source code for the IdentityServer in Docker blog series. It includes both the initial baseline code and the final containerized solution, allowing you to follow along and understand the process of containerizing IdentityServer step-by-step.

## Start Project
The Start Project folder contains the baseline source code, which you can run locally without Docker. You should be able to authenticate successfully using the credentials bob/bob. This serves as the initial starting point that will be gradually containerized through various attempts in the blog series.

## Final Code
The Final Code folder contains the completed solution, showcasing a fully containerized setup with IdentityServer running in Docker. This includes all configurations and optimizations made throughout the guide.

## Important
This blog post focuses on getting the application to work locally in a containerized environment using Docker Compose. Making this setup production-ready involves additional considerations, which are beyond the scope of this post. We aim to successfully run and test the setup in a local development environment and understand the critical decisions made.Important

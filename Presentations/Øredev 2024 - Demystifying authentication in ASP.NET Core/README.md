# Øredev - Demystifying authentication in ASP.NET Core
This folder contains the presentation and the demo code from my talk at the <a href="https://oredev.org" target="_blank">Øredev</a> 2024 conference in Malmö, Sweden.

In this talk, we'll explain how authentication works in ASP.NET Core 8, which can be 
complicated and have many different parts. We'll cover the main ideas, such as schemas, 
handlers, ClaimsPrincipal, claims, challenges, session cookies, and more. It will be a 
practical, in-depth look at how authentication actually works in ASP.NET Core 8.
